# Flask-Tutorial Documentation

This repository demonstrates a microservices-based Flask web application with MongoDB integration. The project is split into two main services: a frontend (user interface) and a backend (database/API), both using Flask, communicating over HTTP, and using MongoDB Atlas for storage.

---

## What is Microservices Architecture?

A microservices architecture splits a project into multiple independent services that communicate over a network. In this project:
- The **frontend** service handles user interaction and presentation.
- The **backend** service handles data storage and business logic.
- Each service runs as a separate Flask app, making the project modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

---

## Project Structure (Overview)

- `Frontend/` (Flask app, port 5000):
  - Renders the HTML form and user interface (UI) for users.
  - Receives user input and proxies form submissions to the backend.
  - Displays backend responses (including MongoDB document IDs) to the user.
- `backend/` (Flask app, port 5001):
  - Handles all database operations (MongoDB Atlas).
  - Receives data from the frontend, stores it, and returns JSON responses.
  - Exposes API endpoints for data insertion and retrieval.
- `.env` (not in repo):
  - Stores sensitive environment variables (e.g., MongoDB URI).
- `flaskenv/` (virtual environment):
  - Contains all installed Python packages for the project.
- `requirements.txt`:
  - Lists all Python dependencies needed to run both services.
- `error_guide.txt`:
  - Logs common errors and solutions encountered during development.
- `flask_mongo_tips.txt`:
  - Best practices and suggestions for Flask + MongoDB development.

---

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **User Accesses the App:**
   - The user opens the frontend in their browser at `http://localhost:5000`.
2. **Form Submission:**
   - The user fills out a form (e.g., signup) and submits it.
   - The frontend Flask app receives the form data and sends it to the backend Flask app at `http://localhost:5001/submit` using an HTTP POST request.
3. **Backend Processing:**
   - The backend receives the data, stores it in MongoDB Atlas, and returns a JSON response containing the unique document ID.
4. **Frontend Displays Result:**
   - The frontend receives the backend's response and displays a success message (including the MongoDB ID) to the user.

This separation allows you to scale, test, and deploy each service independently.

## How to Run the Project (Beginner Friendly)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Flask-Tutorial
   ```
2. **Create a `.env` file:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your MongoDB URI:
     ```
     mongo_uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
     ```
3. **Set up the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv flaskenv
   source flaskenv/bin/activate
   ```
4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. **Start the backend service:**
   ```bash
   python backend/app.py
   # Runs on port 5001
   ```
6. **Start the frontend service:**
   ```bash
   python Frontend/app.py
   # Runs on port 5000
   ```
7. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to `http://localhost:5000` to use the app.

**Tip:** Always start the backend before the frontend so the frontend can reach the backend API.

---

## Environment Variables
- The `.env` file is required in the root directory and should contain:
  ```
  mongo_uri=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
  ```
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` to share variable names with collaborators.

---

## CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- If you encounter CORS errors (browser blocks requests to backend), enable Flask-CORS in the backend:
  ```python
  from flask_cors import CORS
  CORS(app)
  ```
- Only allow trusted origins in production for security.

---

## Error Handling
- Common errors and solutions are logged in `error_guide.txt`.
- If you encounter a new error, add it to the log for future reference.

---

## Best Practices & Tips
- See `flask_mongo_tips.txt` for development tips, security, and deployment suggestions.
- Use virtual environments to avoid dependency conflicts.
- Convert MongoDB ObjectId to string before returning in JSON.
- Keep frontend and backend logic separate for maintainability.
- Document your code and keep your README up to date.

---

## For More Details
- See comments and docstrings in each file for further explanations.
- Log new errors and solutions as you encounter them.
- Ask for help or clarification if you get stuck—this project is designed to be beginner friendly!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Why use two Flask apps instead of one?**  
A: Separating frontend and backend makes your project modular, easier to debug, and more scalable. Each service can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

**Q: What is MongoDB Atlas?**  
A: MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-hosted MongoDB service. It allows you to store and manage your data securely online, accessible from anywhere.

**Q: What if I get a CORS error?**  
A: Make sure Flask-CORS is enabled in the backend and that both services are running on the correct ports.

**Q: How do I add new features?**  
A: Add new routes or logic to the appropriate service (frontend for UI, backend for data/API). Update documentation and test thoroughly.

**Q: Where do I log errors or tips?**  
A: Use `error_guide.txt` for errors and `flask_mongo_tips.txt` for best practices and suggestions.

## Why MongoDB Atlas? (Database Choice Explained)

**What is MongoDB?**
- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database that stores data as flexible, JSON-like documents in collections (similar to tables in SQL).
- It is schema-less, meaning you can store different fields in different documents, making it ideal for projects where data structure may evolve.
- MongoDB is widely used for web applications, rapid prototyping, and projects that require scalability and flexibility.

**What is MongoDB Atlas?**
- MongoDB Atlas is the official cloud-hosted version of MongoDB, managed by MongoDB Inc.
- Atlas provides a free tier for learning and small projects, and you don't need to install or manage MongoDB on your own computer.
- Features include automated backups, scaling, monitoring, and security best practices by default.
- You can access your database securely from anywhere, which is great for distributed teams or cloud deployments.

**Why did we choose MongoDB Atlas for this project?**
- **Beginner Friendly:** No installation required; you can get started with a free cloud database in minutes.
- **Cloud Access:** Your database is accessible from anywhere, not just your local machine.
- **Scalability:** Atlas can scale with your project, from small demos to production apps.
- **Security:** Built-in security features like IP whitelisting, SSL, and user authentication.
- **Integration:** Works seamlessly with Python via the `pymongo` library.
- **Modern Web Stack:** NoSQL databases like MongoDB are commonly used in modern web development, especially with microservices and REST APIs.

**How does it work in this project?**
- The backend Flask app connects to MongoDB Atlas using a connection string stored in your `.env` file (never hard-coded for security).
- When a user submits the signup form, the backend stores the data as a document in the `signups` collection in your Atlas cluster.
- You can view and manage your data using the MongoDB Atlas web dashboard.

**Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas:**
1. Sign up at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create a free cluster (choose the free/shared tier for learning).
3. Add a database user and password.
4. Whitelist your current IP address so your app can connect.
5. Copy your connection string and add it to your `.env` file as `mongo_uri=...`
6. Use the Atlas dashboard to view, edit, or export your data.

 # Best Practices & Tips for Flask + MongoDB Integration

This file contains practical suggestions and reminders for anyone working with Flask and MongoDB (Atlas or local). Refer to these tips to avoid common pitfalls and improve your development experience.

---

## 1. Environment Variables & .env
- Always store sensitive information (like database URIs and credentials) in a `.env` file, not in your code.
- Do not use spaces or quotes in your `.env` variable assignments. Example:
  ```
  mongo_uri=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster-url/dbname
  ```
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use `.env.example` for sharing variable names.

## 2. Virtual Environments
- Always use a virtual environment (e.g., `python3 -m venv flaskenv`) to isolate project dependencies.
- Activate your environment before installing packages or running your app.
- Add your virtual environment folder (e.g., `flaskenv/`) to `.gitignore`.

## 3. MongoDB Atlas Connection
- Make sure your current IP address is whitelisted in the Atlas dashboard.
- Double-check your connection string format and credentials.
- If you change networks (e.g., switch WiFi), update your IP in Atlas.

## 4. Package Management
- Use a `requirements.txt` file to track dependencies. Install with:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Keep packages up to date, especially `pymongo`, `dnspython`, and `certifi` for Atlas SSL support.

## 5. Handling JSON Responses
- MongoDB's `ObjectId` and other custom types are not JSON serializable. Convert them to strings before returning in JSON responses.
- Example:
  ```python
  return {'inserted_id': str(result.inserted_id)}
  ```

## 6. Debugging Imports
- Use `python-dotenv` (not `dotenv`) for loading environment variables.
- Avoid naming your own files or folders the same as popular packages (e.g., `dotenv.py`).

## 7. Security
- Never expose your database credentials or `.env` file in public repositories.
- Use strong, unique passwords for your database users.

## 8. General Flask Tips
- Use `debug=True` only in development, not in production.
- Organize your code with clear comments and docstrings for maintainability.

## 9. Documentation
- Keep a README and error guide for your project.
- Document common errors and their solutions as you encounter them.
